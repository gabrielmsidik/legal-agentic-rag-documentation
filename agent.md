# Legal Agentic RAG Agent Architecture (v3.0)

## Overview

The Legal Agentic RAG Agent is a LangGraph-based state machine that answers legal queries using an intelligent iterative refinement approach:

- **Chain of Thought Memory** - Persistent working memory tracking attempted queries, results, and insights
- **Strategic Planning** - LLM-driven strategy generation integrated into plan_step
- **Hybrid Search** - Vector search (Pinecone) + Graph search (Neo4j) with intelligent routing
- **Intelligent Reranking** - Reranking only in vector space for efficiency
- **Adaptive Search Strategy** - Graph search strategizes based on current strategy (semantic, keyword, principles)
- **Iterative Refinement** - Learns from each iteration to avoid dead-ends and retry patterns

## Key Architectural Changes (v3.0)

### 1. **Chain of Thought Memory** (NEW)
- Persistent working memory throughout agent execution
- Tracks: attempted queries, results summary, promising leads, dead-ends
- Helps avoid retry loops and informs next strategy
- Returned in final response for transparency

### 2. **Integrated Strategic Planning** (REFACTORED)
- `generate_intermediate_question_node` merged into `plan_step`
- Plan step now generates strategy for next search
- Strategy includes: search type, specific approach, what to look for
- Informs route decision and search node behavior

### 3. **Strategy-Aware Route Decision** (ENHANCED)
- Route decision receives strategy context
- Considers graph schema when deciding vector vs graph
- Chooses search method based on query characteristics and strategy

### 4. **Strategic Graph Search** (ENHANCED)
- Receives strategy from plan_step
- Strategizes search approach: semantic, keyword, legal principles
- Adapts search based on current strategy
- Updates chain of thought with findings

### 5. **Vector-Only Reranking** (SIMPLIFIED)
- Reranking only occurs after vector search
- Graph results bypass reranking (already deduplicated)
- Reduces computational overhead
- Cleaner workflow

### 6. **Intelligent Chain of Thought Updates** (NEW)
- Each search node updates CoT with:
  - Query attempted
  - Results summary (count, types, key findings)
  - Promising leads identified
  - Dead-ends detected
  - Suggestions for next iteration

## State Management

### GraphState Structure - v2.0 (Current)

The current agent maintains state through a TypedDict called `GraphState` defined in `src/models/schemas.py`:

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    """Current v2.0 State definition for the LangGraph agent."""
    original_query: str                     # The initial user question
    intermediate_steps: List[tuple]         # History of tool calls and results (for logging/debugging)
    retrieved_context: List[Dict]           # Accumulated context from tools (vector + graph)
    plan: Union[str, None]                  # Agent's plan or next action decision
    response: Union[str, None]              # Final generated answer
    needs_more_info: bool                   # Flag to control potential looping
    iteration_count: int                    # Track number of iterations to prevent infinite loops
    workflow_nodes: List[Dict[str, Any]]    # LangGraph workflow nodes executed (for explainability)

### New Field Details

#### 1. `chain_of_thought: List[str]`

**Purpose**: Persistent working memory tracking the agent's search journey

**Format**: List of string entries, one per iteration or major action

**Example Entry**:
```
Iteration 1 - Planning:
  Strategy: Search for cases discussing stock valuation in matrimonial assets
  Query: "stock picks matrimonial assets division"
  Search Type: vector
  Approach: semantic
  Reasoning: Initial exploration of the topic

Iteration 1 - Vector Search:
  Query: "stock picks matrimonial assets division"
  Results: 5 cases found
  Key Cases: Case A (2023_SGHCF_45), Case B (2022_SGHCF_78)
  Promising Leads: Case A directly discusses stock valuation in asset division
  Dead-ends: None identified yet
  Next Steps: Search for related statutes on asset valuation

Iteration 2 - Planning:
  Strategy: Search graph for statutes and legal principles
  Query: "asset valuation matrimonial division statutes"
  Search Type: graph
  Approach: semantic
  Reasoning: Case A cited Statute X; need to understand legal framework

Iteration 2 - Graph Search:
  Query: "asset valuation matrimonial division statutes"
  Strategy: semantic
  Results: 3 statutes, 2 principles found
  Key Nodes: Statute X (directly addresses stock picks), Principle Y (asset division)
  Relationships: Statute X cited in Case A
  Promising Leads: Statute X directly addresses stock picks in asset division
  Dead-ends: Principle Z not relevant to stock picks
  Next Steps: Vector search for cases citing Statute X

Iteration 3 - Planning:
  Decision: Sufficient information gathered
  Action: Synthesize answer
  Reasoning: Have cases, statutes, and principles; ready to generate answer
```

**Usage**:
- `plan_step` reads CoT to understand what's been attempted
- `plan_step` analyzes CoT to identify promising leads and dead-ends
- `vector_search_node` and `graph_search_node` append to CoT with findings
- `synthesize_answer_node` includes CoT in response for transparency
- Returned in final API response for user visibility

**Benefits**:
- Prevents retry loops by tracking attempted queries
- Informs strategy generation with historical context
- Provides transparency into agent's reasoning
- Enables dead-end detection and avoidance

---

#### 2. `strategy: Union[Dict, None]`

**Purpose**: Current search strategy guiding the next search action

**Structure**:
```python
{
    "search_type": "vector" | "graph",           # Which search to perform
    "approach": "semantic" | "keyword" | "principles" | "combined",  # How to search
    "query": str,                                # Refined query string
    "focus_areas": List[str],                    # Key areas to focus on
    "filters": List[str],                        # Queries/cases to avoid
    "reasoning": str                             # Why this strategy was chosen
}
```

**Example Strategy**:
```python
{
    "search_type": "graph",
    "approach": "semantic",
    "query": "asset valuation matrimonial division statutes",
    "focus_areas": ["stock valuation", "asset division", "matrimonial law"],
    "filters": ["inheritance law", "commercial contracts"],
    "reasoning": "Previous vector search found relevant cases. Now search graph for related statutes and principles to understand legal framework. Avoid inheritance and commercial law as they're not relevant to matrimonial assets."
}
```

**Usage**:
- Generated by `plan_step` based on chain of thought analysis
- Passed to `route_action` to decide search type
- Passed to `vector_search_node` or `graph_search_node` to guide search
- Used by `graph_search_node` to choose search approach (semantic/keyword/principles)

**Benefits**:
- Enables intelligent routing decisions
- Guides adaptive graph search strategies
- Provides context for search refinement
- Helps avoid dead-end queries

    "chain_of_thought": [],
    "strategy": None,
    "retrieved_context": [],
    "iteration_count": 0,
    "needs_more_info": True,
}
```

    "current_query": "stock picks matrimonial assets division",
    "chain_of_thought": ["Iteration 1 - Planning: ..."],
    "strategy": {
        "search_type": "vector",
        "approach": "semantic",

    "chain_of_thought": [
        "Iteration 1 - Planning: ...",
        "Iteration 1 - Vector Search: ..."
    ],
}
```

**After rerank_results_node** (Iteration 1):
```python
{
    "retrieved_context": [top 5 vector sources],
}
```

**After evaluate_results_node** (Iteration 1):
```python
{
    "needs_more_info": True,  # Insufficient information
    "iteration_count": 1,
}
```

**After plan_step** (Iteration 2):
```python
{
    "current_query": "asset valuation matrimonial division statutes",
    "chain_of_thought": [
        "Iteration 1 - Planning: ...",
        "Iteration 1 - Vector Search: ...",
        "Iteration 2 - Planning: ..."
    ],
    "strategy": {
        "search_type": "graph",

```

**Final State** (After synthesis):
```python
{
    "response": "Based on the retrieved sources...",
    "chain_of_thought": [all iterations],
    "retrieved_context": [final sources],
    "needs_more_info": False,
    "iteration_count": 2,
}
```

### API Response Format

**v2.0 Response**:
```python
{
    "answer": str,
    "sources": List[Source],
    "workflow_nodes": List[WorkflowNode]
}
```

**v3.0 Response** (Enhanced):
```python
{
    "answer": str,
    "sources": List[Source],
    "workflow_nodes": List[WorkflowNode],
    "chain_of_thought": List[str]           # NEW: Returned for transparency
}
```

The chain of thought is now visible to users, providing full transparency into the agent's reasoning process.

---

## Deduplication Strategy (v3.0)

### Vector Source Deduplication
- **Key**: `chunk_id` (unique identifier from Pinecone)
- **When**: Before appending to context in vector_search_node
- **When**: Before reranking in rerank_results_node

### Graph Source Deduplication
- **Key**: Node identity (case_number, statute name+section, etc.)
- **When**: Within semantic results
- **When**: Within structured results
- **When**: Between semantic and structured results
- **When**: Before appending to context in graph_search_node

### Cross-Source Deduplication
- **When**: Before reranking (removes duplicates across all sources)
- **Strategy**: Maintains separate tracking for vector and graph sources

---

## Iteration Flow (v3.0)

The agent iterates intelligently based on chain of thought:

1. **Iteration 1**:
   - plan_step (generate initial strategy)
   - route_action (decide vector or graph)
   - search (vector or graph)
   - rerank (vector only)
   - evaluate (check sufficiency)

2. **If insufficient**:
   - plan_step analyzes chain of thought
   - Generates new strategy avoiding dead-ends
   - Back to route_action

3. **If sufficient**:
   - synthesize_answer (generate final answer)
   - END (return answer + sources + chain of thought)

**Max Iterations**: 10 (configurable via recursion_limit)

**Key Improvements**:
- Chain of thought prevents retry loops
- Strategy generation learns from previous iterations
- Dead-end detection avoids wasted searches
- Promising leads guide next searches

## Workflow Nodes (v3.0)

The agent now has **6 main nodes** (down from 7):

1. **plan_step** - Strategic planning with chain of thought
2. **route_action** - Strategy-aware routing decision
3. **vector_search_node** - Semantic search with CoT updates
4. **graph_search_node** - Strategic graph search with CoT updates
5. **rerank_results_node** - Vector-only reranking
6. **evaluate_results_node** - Relevance evaluation
7. **synthesize_answer_node** - Final answer generation

**Removed**: generate_intermediate_question_node (merged into plan_step)

## Implementation Notes

### Chain of Thought Management
- Initialize as empty list in initial state
- Each search node appends a detailed entry
- Plan step reads and analyzes for strategy generation
- Returned in final response for transparency

### Strategy Structure
```python
{
    "search_type": "vector" or "graph",  # Recommended search type
    "approach": "semantic" or "keyword" or "principles" or "combined",  # For graph search
    "query": "refined query string",     # Query to use
    "focus_areas": ["area1", "area2"],   # What to look for
    "filters": ["filter1", "filter2"],   # What to avoid/filter
    "reasoning": "why this strategy"     # Explanation
}
```

### Dead-End Detection
- Track queries that returned no relevant results
- Track queries that returned only previously seen results
- Track queries that contradicted previous findings
- Suggest alternative approaches in strategy

### Promising Lead Tracking
- Identify cases/statutes that directly address query
- Identify relationships that suggest new search directions
- Identify principles that apply to the query
- Suggest follow-up searches based on leads
